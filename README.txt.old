Where are the Jobs 
------------------

SymSoft Solutions. application Where are the Jobs? allows users to interactively explore the salary and job statistics for various occupations at national, state and regional levels. Using the application, they can choose an occupation and explore the job market for that occupation, or they can start with a state or region and explore the top occupations within it. Where are the Jobs? provides context for the user by highlighting the geographic area, plotting the information on a graph for easy comparison and allowing the users to sort either by number of jobs or by salary. The application also provides information about the top industries providing employment in a given occupation.

We believe that this ability to interactively explore employment scenarios across different occupations and geographical areas will assist young men and women who are trying to choose a career, unemployed people who are getting ready to retrain themselves in this weak economy, or citizens and business that are planning to relocate to a different part of the country.

Where are the Jobs? Uses data provided by the US Department of Labor and Bureau of Labor Statistics in May 2010.
The data is available at ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/time.series/oe/
